# mirna-explorer
A set of curated graphical representations to explore the simultaneous effect of hundreds of microRNAs onto thousands of genes.

The code contained in this repository refers to data visualization only. The methods for computing the displayed quantities are publicly available in this other repository [mirna-target-prediction](https://github.com/LucaMarconato/mirna_target_prediction).
Neither this repository, nor the linked one, contains raw or processed data. 

The raw data is publicly avaialbe from the TargetScan website and the TCGA website. In the future, I will describe the pipeline to generate the processed data from the raw one.
